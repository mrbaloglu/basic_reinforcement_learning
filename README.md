## Reinforcement Learning with Applications on Games and Other ML Subjects

This repository contains implementations for algorithms and applications of reinforcement learning. These applications are implemented on basic openai-gym environments such as some games (PixelCopter) or simulations (LunarLander). (see Basic_RL folder)

Moreover, some applications of RL algorithms in text-classification task is also in progress (see RL for NLP folder). Here we use sentiment analysis datasets: Rotten Tomatoes Movie Reviews [1], and IMDB Movie Reviews [2].

Applications of RL in other NLP areas (neural machine translation, keyword extraction, text summarization) and other Machine Learning subjects (computer vision, time-series analysis) will be added in the future.
